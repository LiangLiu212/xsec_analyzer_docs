Documentation for the MCC9 :math:`{\rm CC}0\pi Np` analysis code
================================================================

The ROOT-based C++ code used to obtain the double-differential measurements
of :math:`{\rm CC}0\pi Np` events reported in `MCC9 Double-differential CCNp cross sections <https://microboone-docdb.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/sso/ShowDocument?docid=35518>`_ has been made available on
GitHub in the repository `stv-analysis-new <https://github.com/LiangLiu212/xsec_analyzer/tree/docs>`_.
This note provides some brief documentation for MicroBooNE analyzers who may
wish to reuse the same framework for other measurements.





Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
