Documentation for the MCC9 :math:`{rm CC}0\piNp` analysis code
===================================

The ROOT-based C++ code used to obtain the double-differential measurements
of :math:`{rm CC}0\piNp` events reported in Ref.~\cite{docDB35518} has been made available on
GitHub in the repository \url{https://github.com/sjgardiner/stv-analysis-new}.
This note provides some brief documentation for MicroBooNE analyzers who may
wish to reuse the same framework for other measurements.
